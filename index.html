    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my expertise in software development, data analysis, GNSS, and GIS. My educational experience was enriched by a semester at Warsaw University of Technology through the Erasmus program, where I undertook projects on Visual SLAM and Spatial Analysis, further enhancing my proficiency in English. These experiences not only deepened my technical knowledge but also sharpened my problem-solving abilities and teamwork skills. Through various internships and projects, I successfully applied theoretical concepts to real-world challenges, developing a robust ability to adapt and innovate. As I advance in my professional career, I am excited to leverage these skills and experiences to contribute meaningfully to your organization and drive impactful results.</p>
