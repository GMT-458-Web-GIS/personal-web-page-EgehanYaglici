## Issues
First of all there no ready-to-go templates, everything made by scracth. Due to this web-site can be have some bugs, working issues on different screen sizes etc.

- No mobile design(I do not have enough time for this).
- Dark and light themes are working but they aren't dynamic you shoud open or close it in another tabs(No mode on Fav Places).

#### First page animations took 4-5 hours in total specially the mail animation gave some trouble to me.
#### I use a CESIUM API for the 3D World Map. I am not going to set a spesific url for API KEY. If anyone want to use it they can use the same key for getting the interactive 3D World Map. Key belongs to me but this assignment is public so Ä± allow that.
