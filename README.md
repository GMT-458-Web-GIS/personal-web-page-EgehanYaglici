## Latest Update
- Dynamic Light/Dark mode added for every tab, user can be open it on first page and other pages take that input for opening the dark mode. This function does not work on first commit ı just delete a comment and re-upload now page works. Probably GitHub issues :D. 
- Some style updates too

## Issues
First of all there no ready-to-go templates, everything made by scracth. Due to this web-site can be have some bugs, working issues on different screen sizes etc.

- No mobile design(I do not have enough time for this).

#### First page animations took 4-5 hours in total specially the mail animation gave some trouble to me.
#### I use a CESIUM API for the 3D World Map. I am not going to set a spesific url for API KEY. If anyone want to use it they can use the same key for getting the interactive 3D World Map. Key belongs to me but this assignment is public so ı allow that.
